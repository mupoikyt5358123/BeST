Once you’ve recovered your account, it’s crucial to secure it to prevent it from being hacked again. Instagram offers several ways to keep your account protected.

- Choose between **Text Message (SMS)** or **Authentication Apps** like Google Authenticator or Authy.

To make sure your account stays safe, change your password at least every 3-6 months. Choose a **strong, unique password** with a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

#### **Review Account Activity**:
Check your **login activity** regularly to spot any unusual devices or logins that might indicate your account has been accessed without your permission.

#### **Be Wary of Phishing**:
Instagram accounts are often targeted by phishing attempts. If you receive suspicious emails or DMs asking for your login credentials, **don’t click any links**. Instagram will never ask for your password through email.
